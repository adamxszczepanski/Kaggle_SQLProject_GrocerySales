# Grocery Sales — SQL Analysis

This repository contains a SQL project based on a public Kaggle grocery sales dataset.  
Its purpose is to practice analytical SQL and extract meaningful business insights from retail data.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Explore and understand the dataset structure  
- Clean and transform data directly in SQL  
- Analyse sales by store, category, product and time  
- Calculate key KPIs (revenue, quantity, ranking of top items)  
- Practice CTEs and window functions in a real dataset  

A Power BI dashboard based on this project is planned as a next step.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **MySQL**
- Joins, aggregates, `GROUP BY`
- **CTEs**
- **Window functions** (ranking, running totals)
- Conditional logic (`CASE`)
- Clean, modular query structure

## 🔍 Key Analyses

The SQL script answers common business questions such as:

- Which stores and categories generate the most revenue?
- What are the top-selling products by quantity and by revenue?
- How do sales vary across months or days of the week?
- Are there visible trends or seasonality patterns?
